1. A bee visits around 14.400 flowers by day. How many days is required to visit up to 240.00 flowers?

2. Florence received instructions to take a medicine for five days, with intervals of 12 hours between each pill. Her husband arrived from the drugstore with a card of 10 pills. Florence complained that those card would not last until the the end of  her medication period. Is she right?

3. Tom and Amanda need to buy hummingbird food. In the store, Amanda found a tiny bucket costing 6 dollars, containing 150g of food, and a larger package costing 18 dollars, containg 600g of the same food. She decides to buy the 18-dolars package. When they got  the checkout, Tom complained about Amanda's decision to buy the more expensive package. Is Tom right? Did Amanda make a decision that was less advantageous in term of money?

4. In a medicine market, the company A sells the sodic diclofenac in a card containing 10 pills. The card will be sold for $ 5.50. Each pill contains 200mg of sodic diclofenac. The medicine company B, sells the same medicine. One of the internal team from company B start the production of cards containing 10 pills, but with each pill having 100mg of sodic diclofenac. The card will be sold for $ 5.00. The argument is: each consumer will be the same, no matter how much concentration of sodic diclofenac is required. Furthermore, we will have monetary gain in the chemical production, as we will spend just the half of what the company B uses, selling for the same card. What do you mean about the decision of company B, on selling the medicine with a half of the concentration from company A, but with the same price? Do you will do more considerations about the price decision?
